# EV-Infrastructure & Growth Analytics
An end-to-end Data Engineering and Predictive Analytics project exploring the global Electric Vehicle (EV) charging station landscape.

📊 Project Overview
This project analyzes a comprehensive dataset of 5,000+ EV charging stations to identify operational trends, financial performance, and infrastructure growth. It transitions from raw data handling in Excel to complex SQL management and ends with Advanced Machine Learning in Python.

🛠️ Technical Stack
* Data Preprocessing: Python (Pandas, NumPy) for ETL, cleaning, and feature engineering (Revenue/Utilization metrics).

* Database Management: SQL (MySQL/SQLite) via SQLAlchemy for structured data storage and complex analytical querying.

* Machine Learning: * Regression Analysis: Polynomial models to forecast infrastructure growth through 2030.

* Unsupervised Learning: K-Means Clustering to segment stations into "Premium," "Value," and "Underperformer" profiles.

* Data Visualization: Seaborn and Matplotlib for diagnostic heatmaps and trend analysis.

💡 Key Insights
* Forecasting: Predicted a steady growth trend in station installations, identifying a shift towards market maturity by 2030.

* Segmentation: Mathematically grouped stations to identify "Premium Hubs" with 80+ daily users and $0.37/kWh pricing models.

* Sustainability: Correlated Renewable Energy sources with customer satisfaction ratings to prove the business value of green energy.
